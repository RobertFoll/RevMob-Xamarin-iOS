A Xamarin wrapper for the RevMob iOS SDK
=======

A sample project is included.
For the technical specifications and documentation of the SDK, see http://sdk.revmobmobileadnetwork.com/ios.html
This is my personal project, I'm not affiliated with RevMob in any way. I appreciate all your input, feedback, and especially contributions!
The binding was built using Xamarin.iOS Version: 8.6.0.51 as a Unified API iOS Binding Project using RevMob iOS SDK version 8.1.0

Instructions
=======

1. Obtain a RevMob Media ID at revmob.com.
2. Paste the ID into the sample project.

Credits
=======

RevMob deserves all the credit as all I have done is create a Xamarin.iOS binding for the SDK.
